<bogy bgcolor="#ffffff">
<center><font size=4><b>Graphics Counter</b></font></center>
<p>
This is a graphical counter that is called from the img tag.
<br><center><img src="/counter/counter.cgi?counter-index.txt"></center><p>

<b>Usage is:</b><br>

<pre>

&lt;img src="/counter/counter.cgi?CounterDataFile">
 
for example, if your CounterDataFile was count.txt :
 
&lt;img src="/counter/counter.cgi?count.txt">
</pre>
<p>
The count file name should some how represent the page and directory
its located in so you dont mistakenly use duplicate names. A good example
would be if the directory is counters and the html page is called index.htm
than name the couter file counters-index.txt. This would make the img src
tag the following.<br>

<pre>

&lt;img src="/counter/counter.cgi?counters-index.txt">

</pre>
<p>
You can edit the count on any page by going to the counter directory
off of your main www and changing the number in the txt file of the page
you would like to correct.
